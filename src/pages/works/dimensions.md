## Generative art and augmented reality

On August 2019, Canva Philippines celebrated its fifth year. Part of the event was an art exhibit featuring works of Canva employees.

I joined because it sounded like a fun opportunity to push myself and learn new things!

I knew right away that the art medium had to be **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JS**, and I wanted it to somehow be an interactive experience.

After struggling for inspiration (and after one failed attempt), I’ve come up with a **generative art** and **augmented reality** concept.

The general plan was to make two components — one physical print and one <abbr title="augmented reality">AR</abbr> app.

I will go into more detail in each component in the following posts: [**Part 1. Generative art**](dimensions1.html) and [**Part 2. Augmented reality**](dimensions2.html).
