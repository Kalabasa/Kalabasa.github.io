# Canva Enterprise

![screenshot](../img/canvaenterprise_1.jpg)

One of my first projects at Canva was a page that showcases Canva’s Enterprise offering. I was responsible for the dev work on its front page.

It has some cool animations.

<span class="bleed">
	<video muted autoplay loop>
		<source src="../video/canvaenterprise_2.mp4">
		<a href="../video/canvaenterprise_2.mp4">Video</a>
	</video>
</span>

The animations were implemented using a bunch of CSS 3D transforms, animations, and some JS to orchestrate it all.

I enjoyed animating the whole scene and doing all the little details (like how the shadows respond to the sheets' heights). Kudos to our designers for the neat concept.

Halfway through the project, it was handed over to another dev, as I needed to focus elsewhere. So the inner screens (survey part) weren’t done by me. It was all done in a little over a month.
