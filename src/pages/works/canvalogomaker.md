Logo Maker is a tool to generate a customized logo in Canva. You can supply the brand name, style, and colors; it will do the rest! <small>Actually, color customization isn't available yet, but will be soon!</small>

My role here is the implementation of the nice landing page and the "choices" modal interface.

I also did some integration with the editor, but the amazing Smart Design team did the magic! They are able to generate dynamic pixel-perfect designs with several parameters!

Once the design is generated, it can be further customized using all of Canva's features.

This cool project was made possible by the cool people at Canva - spanning multiple teams! - from template designers to product engineers.
