## Chill music to quarantine to.

**Isolation** is a single I composed during the 2020 pandemic.

I made it using LMMS and Audacity, which are both free and open-source software for music and audio production.

I don‚Äôt know what to write for this page so I guess I‚Äôll write about music theory! <small>Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not an expert.</small>

In this piece I leaned heavily on the [**voices**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_leading) that make up the harmony.

The composition was built using a bottom-up approach. Instead of deciding on the chord progression and structures beforehand, the individual melodic lines ("voices") were formed in parallel to build up the harmony.

I think this might also be called [**counterpoint**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint) in classical terms. <small>idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</small>

Here is the resulting chord progression in the key of C:

<span class="center">
	<strong>Em</strong><sup>7</sup>&emsp;
	<strong>E</strong><sup>o‚ô≠6</sup>&emsp;
	<strong>F</strong><sup>M7</sup>&emsp;
	<strong>F</strong><sup>o7</sup>
</span>

The result of the voice-heavy composition was noticeable ‚Äì There were no strong movements in the chord progression.

Rather, the movement of the music was driven by the individual voice lines.

<span class="caption">There are four voice lines that can be seen in the piano roll.</span>

Same for the bass. The bass line was written to accompany the harmony. <small>(simplified here for illustration)</small>

<div style="text-align:center">
	<sup>Em / </sup><strong>C</strong>&emsp;
	<sup>E<sup>o</sup> / </sup><strong>B‚ô≠</strong>&emsp;
	<sup>F / </sup><strong>A</strong>&emsp;
	<sup>F<sup>o</sup> / </sup><strong>A‚ô≠</strong><br/>
	<sup>Em / </sup><strong>E</strong>&emsp;
	<sup>E<sup>o</sup> / </sup><strong>E</strong>&emsp;
	<sup>F / </sup><strong>F</strong>&emsp;
	<sup>F<sup>o</sup> / </sup><strong>F</strong>
</div>

They all work together to create a steady and chill sound to quarantine to.

There are no choruses or big movements because that‚Äôs drama, not chill.

In retrospect, the title of the piece coincidentally gets a new meaning in the context of music theory.

An *Isolation* of voices.

Just like our social *Isolation* in this pandemic.

Isolated, yet still working together. <small>(well, ideally)</small>
