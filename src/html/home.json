			"I am an introvert who likes games, programming, and music.",

I have broken and fixed my <a target='_blank' href='https://www.google.com/search?q=linux+sucks'>computer</a> countless times and spent a lot of my youth toying with <a target='_blank' href='http://classic.battle.net/war3/faq/worldeditor.shtml'>map</a> <a target='_blank' href='http://www.ceebot.com/blupimania/index-e.php'>editors</a> or <a target='_blank' href='http://www.clonk.de/index.php?lng=en'>mod</a> stuff in video games.",
