			"I started programming when I was just a young boy. Even before that, I have already been making things with pen and paper, LEGO bricks, stuff, and video game level editors. I currently inhabit the Philippines. I like games, programming, art, and music, or any combination of those. As it happens, the most exciting combination of those four things is video game development, and that is why I want to work more on that field.",
			"Other stuff that interest me are design, music theory, cinematography, and engineering. Although I'm more interested in the processes than the products themselves"
